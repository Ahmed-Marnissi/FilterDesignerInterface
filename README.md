# FilterDesignerInterface
# Motivation
To implement a digital filter on a microcontroller you need to know its recurent equation 
For this we need to know the transfer function of the filter, then we need to do the z-transformation and finally calculate the recurrent equation.
# Solution
I have developed a Qt interface that allows you to do the necessary calculations to create a digital filter.
